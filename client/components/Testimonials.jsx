                    <div className="testText">"Had our old hot water cylinder die on us recently. Flash gas and plumbing came out,
                    installed new cylinder but unfortunately the pipes under the house were not up to the task.
                    So an infinity gas water system was installed. Wow what a difference, pressure is out of this world.
                       Big ups to Cam, was a nightmare job but he was equal to the task.<br /><br /> Highly recommend to anyone."<br /><br /> - <i>Andrew Gunn</i></div>

                    <div className="testText">"Cam worked with best care and respect during -what surprisingly turned into- an extremely tricky job! He managed the complexity of a total
                    revamp to the hot water supply and installing an Infinity Gas Hot Water completing this work around the tenant. He left his work spaces very
                    tidily, kept in contact with me throughout, sending me pictures of progress and finish so as an absentee owner I have a good picture of the
                       new installation.<br /><br /> The tenant is delighted with new pressure and heat of the water. Given this turned into a major overhaul instead of hot
                       water cylinder replacement, Cam kept me posted with the change of pricing, helped out to minimise costs and updated me throughout. Highly
                       recommend to all! - Big thanks, Cam!"<br /><br /> - <i>Katja Widder</i></div>

                    quote for me within 24 hours. Job completed today first thing after the weekend. Thanks for the priority being a hot water emergency, so looking forward to a hot
                       shower tonight.<br /><br /> Helpful, good communication, fair and personable. I am happy to recommend."<br /><br /> - <i>Cheryl White</i></div>
